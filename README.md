# mastermind_ruby
The game of mastermind, with a player competing against the computer. Written in Ruby.

Before Starting:
  This project will be very challenging. My approach will be to chop the program up into micro-programs. I will attempt to follow Sandi Metz rules for programming, and I will try to use many small objects instead of fewer large ones. This program will allow me to grow not only in Ruby, but also OOP in general.
